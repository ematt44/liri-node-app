# liri-node-app

// In this assignment, you will make LIRI. LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.


LIRI will display your latest tweets. As we do not want to display your personal account, or its keys, please make an alias account and add a few tweets to it!

Make a new GitHub repository called liri-node-app and clone it to your computer.

To retrieve the data that will power this app, you'll need to send requests to the Twitter, Spotify and OMDB APIs. You'll find these Node packages crucial for your assignment.


node liri.js my-tweets
This will show your last 20 tweets and when they were created at in your terminal/bash window.
node liri.js spotify-this-song '<song name here>'
This will show the following information about the song in your terminal/bash window

Artist(s)
The song's name
A preview link of the song from Spotify
The album that the song is from
If no song is provided then your program will default to "The Sign" by Ace of Base.

You will utilize the node-spotify-api package in order to retrieve song information from the Spotify API.

Like the Twitter API, the Spotify API requires you sign up as a developer to generate the necessary credentials. You can follow these steps in order to generate a client id and client secret:

Step One: Visit https://developer.spotify.com/my-applications/#!/

Step Two: Either login to your existing Spotify account or create a new one (a free account is fine) and log in.

Step Three: Once logged in, navigate to https://developer.spotify.com/my-applications/#!/applications/create to register a new application to be used with the Spotify API. You can fill in whatever you'd like for these fields. When finished, click the "complete" button.

Step Four: On the next screen, scroll down to where you see your client id and client secret. Copy these values down somewhere, you'll need them to use the Spotify API and the node-spotify-api package.

node liri.js movie-this '<movie name here>'
This will output the following information to your terminal/bash window:
